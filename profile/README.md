We are [Artisan Build](https://artisan.build). We're the Technical Co-Founders of a growing number of companies that want to use technology to better engage with their markets.
Our modular approach to developing Laravel applications means that we are prolific package creators. We've been building up a huge collection of "dog food" for over a year and we've
decided to make it available for other developers to use. Our approach to open-source is a little different from most maintainers. We build exactly what we need and optimize it for
our own use case. We do not accept issues or pull requests from the general public on any of our packages. They are all released under the MIT license, so if anything doesn't quite meet 
your needs, you are free (and encouraged) to fork it and make it your own.

## The Artisan Build Community

Another thing that's a little different about how we operate is that we build many of our commercial products in public. Anyone who wants to see how we work and do a deep dive into the
pieces of the Laravel ecosystem that we use is invited to join the [Artisan Build Community](https://artisan.community). Every week, we open up meetings, pairing sessions, and other
parts of our workflow to members of the community. We teach as we go, so you can think of the Artisan Build Community as a free online course on how to build profitable commercial
applications with Laravel. There is no cost to join.

We offer a premium tier of the Artisan Build Community that includes weekly private webinars, mobbing sessions, additional educational content, and contributor access to our packages.
It also includes access to our internal documentation for all of our packages, which goes into great depth on how to extend and customize the packages as well as code samples, videos,
and everything else we create to supercharge our application development process.

## Our Packages

**Hallway Core -** A headless community management platform that serves as the back end of [Hallway.fm](https://hallway.fm), an alternative to Slack and Discord that 
we are releasing in 2025.

**Hallway Flux -** A FluxUI client for the Hallway Core package that will serve as the foundation for the web version of Hallway.fm.

**Hallway Native (Coming Soon) -** A PHP Native client for Hallway Core.

**Hallway Mobile (Coming Soon?) -** If Simon Hamp really has cracked the code on creating mobile apps with PHP, this will be the first mobile app we build. As the name implies,
it will be a mobile client for Hallway Core.

**Docsidian -** A Laravel package that transforms and publishes an Obsidian vault. We initially built it to manage our documentation, but it could also be used to power a blog or
publish an Obsidian vault. It allows for per-site, per-page, and per-section authorization so that you can gate and even paywall part or all of your Obsidian content.

**Adverbs -** A collection of utilities for [Verbs](https://verbs.thunk.dev/) that allow us to rapidly prototype applications and save us a ton of repetitive typing when creating
events and states.

**Shorty -** A Laravel package that allows us to add WordPress-style shortcodes to our Laravel apps.
